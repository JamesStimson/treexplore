# **treexplore**

### Introduction

This is **treexplore**, a demo for showing interactive tree plots.

It's based on an MSc project I did at Imperial College, London.

A formal description of the tree distance metric is written up in [Estimating Transmission from Genetic and Epidemiological Data: A Metric to Compare Transmission Trees](http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/17-STS637), by 
Michelle Kendall, Diepreye Ayabina, Yuanwei Xu, James Stimson, and Caroline Colijn.

The code in this repo was used to generate the MDS plot in that paper, comparing transmission tree inference methods.

### Installation

You can run the **treexplore** demo in **R** using the following command:
```{r}
runGitHub( "treexplore", "JamesStimson") 
```

### Getting help

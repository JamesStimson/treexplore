<p>Two different representations of the median transmission trees are shown here:
</p>
<p>
A timed <strong>transmission tree</strong>, where
<ul>
<li> Each red circle shows the date when that host was sampled</li>
<li> Transmission events are represented as vertical arrows</li>
<li> Horizontal lines represent the time for which that particular host was infected</li>
<li> Unlabelled lines correspond to unsampled cases when they are inferred by the model</li>
<li> Arrangement of cases in the vertical direction is arbitrary and confers no meaning</li> 
</ul>
A <strong>transmission network</strong>, where
<ul>
<li> Neither horizontal nor vertical directions have meaning</li>
<li> The numbered circles represent hosts</li>
<li> Where modelled, individual inferred unsampled cases are shown (in orange)</li>
<li> The plot is <strong>interactive</strong>: network nodes can be moved around, and the plot can be zoomed using the mouse wheel</li> 
</ul>
In the plots below, the tip or nodes are labelled with the case numbers from the source data. 
</p>
<p>
Note: the transmission dates are taken directly from the model output <strong>except</strong> in the case of SCOTTI, which does not provide them. Instead, the dates are taken to be shortly after the earliest possible date following the host's initial infection. This explains the rapid re-infection times implied by the SCOTTI plots both here and on the Results page.</p>
